  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>As an artist driven by curiosity and creativity, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of traditional techniques and digital tools. My journey into 3D modelling began in 2021, marking a new chapter in my artistic life.</p>
  <p>I am a designer for a sculpture company and an upcoming graduate with a Bachelor of Visual Arts degree. I specialize in creating realistic character-driven designs using Blender, which is essential to my work, enabling me to bring creative visions to life.</p>
  <p>As the founder of 3D-OZWORX, my goal is to create captivating, high-quality art that inspires others. I'm committed to pushing boundaries within 3D art, exploring new technologies, and showcasing designs globally.</p>
