      As an artist, I feel the need to experiment with different techniques 
      and to constantly improve on my skills while also touching on 
      interesting concepts, for example, playing with relationships between 
      technology, art, and culture.
  </p>

  <p>
      My concept, 'The Crow's Conformity,' is about capturing the essence 
      of consumerism in a way that's both interesting and new. I have made 
      a 3D-printed sculpture of a crow entangled in glowing RGB wires 
      leaning over a stimulating screen with constant scrolling of social 
      media images.

      This artwork is about creating a thoughtful experience that invites 
      the viewers to reflect on their own everyday habits. I invite the 
      viewer to self-reflect on who is really in control. I hope to create 
      an art piece that challenges people's perceptions of contemporary 
      consumer culture.
